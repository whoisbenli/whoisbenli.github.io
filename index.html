<p>How to deal with FAILs.</p>

<h3>
<a name="prevention" class="anchor" href="#prevention"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prevention</h3>

<p>Don't write bugs in the first place!</p>

<p>Keep things simple. Simpler things are simpler to build and understand</p>

<ul>
<li>simpler product design</li>
<li>simpler implementation architecture</li>
<li>simple code/logic</li>
<li>simpler api interfaces</li>
</ul><p>Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>simpler code is easier to reason about</li>
<li>clever code means hard to debug</li>
<li>be kind to your future self</li>
</ul><p>Engineering Process &amp; Infrastructure</p>

<ul>
<li>design, code reviews</li>
<li>unit tests, harnesses, automated testing</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="failure-mode" class="anchor" href="#failure-mode"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Failure Mode</h3>

<p>Make it easy to triage bugs when they eventually do happen</p>

<ul>
<li>logs - make it easy to trace program state and execution</li>
<li>keep intermediate info for debugging</li>
<li>harnesses - for reproducing and isolating issues in controlled environment</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="stages-of-an-issue" class="anchor" href="#stages-of-an-issue"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stages of an Issue</h2>

<p>This standardizes the vocabulary around what state an issue is in.</p>

<h3>
<a name="filed" class="anchor" href="#filed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Filed</h3>

<p>Issue has been documented in a ticketing system.</p>

<h3>
<a name="reproduced" class="anchor" href="#reproduced"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reproduced</h3>

<p>You are able to consistently reproduce the problem</p>

<h3>
<a name="triaged" class="anchor" href="#triaged"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Triaged</h3>

<p>You know exactly what is going wrong and why, and you know how to fix it.
This means that we can estimate how long it would take to fix the issue AND push the patch to the production. 
As usual, be conservative in your commitment date to customers if CS needs one.</p>

<h3>
<a name="review" class="anchor" href="#review"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Review</h3>

<p>You have a fix waiting for review in gerrit. Link to the gerrit change.</p>

<h3>
<a name="fixed" class="anchor" href="#fixed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fixed</h3>

<p>The change is merged.</p>

<h3>
<a name="waiting" class="anchor" href="#waiting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Waiting</h3>

<p>We are waiting on some third party to fix something. Usually just assign to Tech Services to follow up.</p>

<h3>
<a name="resolved" class="anchor" href="#resolved"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resolved</h3>

<p>The fix is in production. Mark a jira as resolved only when it has been released. This tells FQA/CS to verify the fix and communicate that fact to our customers.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ignored" class="anchor" href="#ignored"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ignored</h3>

<p>Issue is ignored because it is reproducible, or it we won't fix it for whatever reason.</p>

<h3>
<a name="test-case" class="anchor" href="#test-case"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Case</h3>

<p>Test cases added</p>

<h3>
<a name="verified" class="anchor" href="#verified"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Verified</h3>

<p>Stakeholder/QA verified issue is fixed and test case exists.</p>

<h3>
<a name="process-notes" class="anchor" href="#process-notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>(Process Notes)</h3>

<p>Please update JIRA as progress is made
Update Immune system field, if N/A, include good reasons why!, gerrit change url
Include postmortem in the jira. Level of detail should correspond to severity and complexity of issue.</p>

<h2>
<a name="priorities" class="anchor" href="#priorities"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Priorities</h2>

<h3>
<a name="critical" class="anchor" href="#critical"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Critical</h3>

<p>Work until fixed, no sleep, detailed postmortem required</p>

<h3>
<a name="high" class="anchor" href="#high"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>High</h3>

<p>Stop and fix
If discovered by customer, eta + daily updates</p>

<h3>
<a name="medium" class="anchor" href="#medium"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Medium</h3>

<p>Schedule - e.g. 1 per week. Put it in the plan.</p>

<h2>
<a name="what-you-should-know-or-ask-about-every-issue" class="anchor" href="#what-you-should-know-or-ask-about-every-issue"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What you should know or ask about every issue</h2>

<h3>
<a name="source" class="anchor" href="#source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Source</h3>

<p>How did we find out about the issue?</p>

<ul>
<li>automated tests, staging, qa, uat, internal users, customer report?</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="triage-priority" class="anchor" href="#triage-priority"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Triage Priority</h3>

<p>What's the initial priority and criticality?
Is it severe enough to consider a rollback if caused by a recent release?</p>

<h3>
<a name="account" class="anchor" href="#account"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Account</h3>

<p>What is the errant behavior?
What are the steps taken to reproduce it?
Was there an active modification of the running system? What was the timing and sequence of events?</p>

<ul>
<li>Deployments, configuration, migrations, etc.
What is the expected behavior?</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="scope" class="anchor" href="#scope"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope</h3>

<p>How does it impact the customer? Which customers?
What parts of the product are affected?
Could this be more of a product design bug?</p>

<h3>
<a name="reproduction" class="anchor" href="#reproduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reproduction</h3>

<p>Be able to deterministically reproduce the issue
If the issue was found in a prerelease version, is it also found in production?
Make is as easy as possible to reproduce the issue (configure test ads, harnesses, etc)</p>

<ul>
<li>This way, colleagues downstream don't have to duplicate work.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="triage" class="anchor" href="#triage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Triage</h3>

<p>When was the issue introduced? By who? Who else was involved?
Under what circumstances does it happen, or not happen?</p>

<p>Isolate the issue - what is the smallest case (use harness/unit tests) that reproduces the issue?
Figure out projects affected - client vs server vs console vs db, etc
Eliminate causes by examining scope across dimensions - pubs, ads, integration types, ad types, client platform types
Could it be caused by an external party? Get proof if so, so Tech Services can communicate.</p>

<p>What part of the code is causing the issue and why? Use debugger, logs</p>

<p>*In light of this new information, has the priority changed?</p>

<h3>
<a name="fix" class="anchor" href="#fix"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fix</h3>

<p>What needs to be done to fix the issue? How long will it take? What can we commit to?
Could it potentially introduce other problems? How risky is it?
Is it a symptom of a larger design issue? Should that be fixed as well?
Could the same class of bugs be present elsewhere? Should a more thorough code audit be performed?
Create an automated test case to prevent regressions.</p>

<h3>
<a name="postmortem" class="anchor" href="#postmortem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Postmortem</h3>

<p>Was the issue verified to be fixed by the stakeholders?
Why was the issue not caught by our product development process?
Is it the result of a common practice that should be discontinued?
Does everyone know what to do to prevent this from happening again?
Do we need better infrastructure to identify bugs?</p>

<h3>
<a name="follow-up-actions" class="anchor" href="#follow-up-actions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Follow up Actions</h3>

<p>How do we change our product development process to ensure that this class of issues do not happen again?</p>

<ul>
<li>prd, design review, implementation, unit tests, integration tests, code review, qa, deployment</li>
</ul><p>If longer term effort is required to change the process or introduce new infrastructure, What is being done in the meantime?</p>
